## A. Overview

The assignment consisted of implementing the front-end of a ride sharing

the distance to the nearest driver or passenger.

## B. Implementation

I believe that everything has been correctly implemented.

## C. Collaboration

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

## D. Time spent

I believe I spent around three hours on this assignment.
