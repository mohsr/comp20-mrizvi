## A. Purpose of this repository

This repository serves two purposes. First, it is a place for me to maintain 
version control over my work and to store my work non-locally. Second, it is 
a place for me to showcase the work I have done while in COMP20.

## B. My favorite assignment

My favorite COMP20 assignment was assignment 3, where we wrote server-side 
code. It was really cool building the behind-the-scenes moving parts of a 
website and integrating that website with a database and testing it and 
seeing all the different dependencies and pieces work together. It's also a 
really good skill to have, since you can only do so much from the front-end 
of a website.

## C. How much have I grown

I've grown a lot since starting the course. Initially, I did not know a 
lot about how the web worked, and I certainly didn't know about things like 
request headers and HTTP GET and POST commands. Now, I have a good 
perspective of how the web works and how its many parts interact. With this, 
I can learn a lot more and try out many more things, and I'll be able to 
seek out new opportunities.

## D. The most important thing I've learned

The most important thing I've learned is how a web app works and what the 
different parts of a web app are, and what you can do from the client-side and 
the server-side, as well as the role of the database. This is shown by two 
things: the assignments I've worked on in COMP20 (including the final project, 
in which I am working on the server-side), and my role on a JumboCode team 
doing web development this semester (where I am also working on the 
server-side).

## E. What would I delve into next?

I would really like to delve deeper into server-side development and try 
out different server-side frameworks and technologies.
