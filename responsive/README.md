# *README*

## A. Overview

The assignment consisted of implementing a website that used media queries 
and stylesheets with CSS to change the displayed content of an image based 
on browser width.

## B. Implementation

I believe that everything has been correctly implemented.

## C. Collaboration

TA John Collins helped me figure out why some of my media queries weren't 
initially working.

## D. Time spent

I think I spent around 1.5-2 hours on the assignment.
