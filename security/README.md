# A. Overview

The assignment was to perform a security and privacy assessment of a web 
application (homeworks 2 and 3). Note that since my assigned partner's 
homeworks 3 did not function properly (and thus the assignment 2 did not 
as well), I used solely the assignment 3 provided by Ming.

# B. Implementation

I believe that the whole assignment has been completed successfully.

# C. Collaboration

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

# D. Time Spent

I spent 2-3 hours working on the assignment.
