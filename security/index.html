	<h2>Security Assessment</h1>
	<h3>Mohsin Rizvi</h3>
	<h4>I. Introduction</h4>
	<p>
		The product is the backend server of a ride-sharing service. I was 
		hired to analyze the server for vulnerabilities and write a report 
		on my findings.
	</p>
	<h4>II. Methodology</h4>
	<p>
		I started with an analysis of the source code, and I noted down any 
		potential vulnerabilities.
		<ul>
			<li>
				I noticed that entries to the POST /rides route are not 
				sanitized and are later given to the user via the GET / route 
				and GET /vehicle.json routes, telling me of a potential
				cross-site scripting vulnerability.
			</li>
			<li>
				I noticed that the query strings given to the GET /vehicle.json 
				route are not sanitized before being used as input in the 
				MongoDB database. This tells me of a potential MongoDB/NoSQL
				injection vulnerability.
			</li>
			<li>
				I noticed that the main page, accessed through GET /, lists 
				all passengers and the place they last made a request from. 
				This stuck out to me as a privacy issue, as it allows anyone 
				to access customer data.
			</li>
		</ul>

		Where appropriate, I used curl to test POST exploits and Firefox for 
		GET exploits.<br/>

		Tools used included:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Firefox for testing GET / and GET /vehicle.json.
			</li>
			<li>
				curl for sending POST requests to POST /rides.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h4>III. Abstract of Findings</h4>
	<p>
		Overall, the vulnerabilities found were mostly technical injection 
		vulnerabilities, with one privacy issue found. The first injection
		vulnerability is an issue that allows attackers to send malicious 
		code to be unwillingly executed by other users. The second injection 
		vulnerability is an issue where search inputs are not properly 
		verified to be safe, and so searches for information can return 
		unintended data. The privacy issue is the fact that all passengers 
		have their information listed on the home page. This leaks 
		sensitive information about all passengers who use the web application.
	</p>
	<h4>IV. Issues Found</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Issue: Cross-site Scripting <br/>
				Location: JavaScript can be injected through the username 
				field when executing POST /rides. This information is 
				collected in server.js line 18 and is inserted into the 
				database on line 36. It is reflected back through GET / at 
				line 99.<br/>
				Severity: High. A cross-site scripting vulnerability could 
				allow an attacker to do many malicious things, such as 
				stealing cookies and executing cryptocurrency-mining 
				JavaScript. <br/>
				Description: I found this issue upon inspecting the source code 
				and seeing that unsanitized POST arguments are inserted into 
				the database. JavaScript can be injected into the website 
				through the POST /rides route as a username value. It can 
				later be executed when accessing the GET / route, which will 
				run the JavaScript on the browser of the user. See CWE-79 in 
				section VI and pictures below.<br/>
				Proof of vulnerability: See pictures below. <br/>
				<img src="images/post_xss.png" /> <img src="images/get_xss.png" /> <br/>
				Resolution: Sanitize inputs to prevent JavaScript injection. A
				simple (yet somewhat draconic) example line of code to do this: <br/>
				<code>if (username.includes('&lt;script&gt;')) {username = '';}</code> <br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				Issue: MongoDB/NoSQL Injection <br/>
				Location: MongoDB operators can be injected in query strings 
				when executing GET /vehicle.json. The query string is collected 
				in file server.js line 69, and it is used unsanitized in a 
				query on line 75. <br/>
				Severity: High. Due to the server software, only one entry is 
				returned at a time, but this could still be used in repetition 
				with different query values each time to potentially access 
				many different documents in the database. For example: the 
				query string "username[$ne]=mohsinrizvi" returns a single 
				document for a user called JANET. But the string 
				"username[$ne]=JANET" can then be used to get another document, 
				and so on. A proof-of-concept is shown in the images below. <br/>
				Description: I found this issue by inspecting the source code 
				and seeing that the query strings are used unsanitized 
				as database queries. Unsanitized query strings are used as input to 
				a MongoDB query, which can include operators to access 
				unintended data, leading to information leakage. See 
				CWE-943 in section VI and images below. <br/>
				Proof of vulnerability: See pictures below. <br/>
				<img src="images/db_1.png" /> <img src="images/db_2.png" /> <br/>
				Resolution: Sanitize database inputs to prevent MongoDB 
				operator injection. A simple way to do this is as follows: <br/>
				<code>if (query.includes('$')) {response.send({});}</code> <br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				Issue: Passenger Information Exposure <br/>
				Location: The GET / route sends the username of all passengers 
				as well as the last place they requested a vehicle from, sorted 
				by time. The data is formatted as HTML in file server.js on line 
				99 and is sent on line 103. <br/>
				Severity: High. The exposure could be exploited to track and 
				locate users of the app, since it is sorted by time (so an 
				attacker could identify someone's location exactly after they 
				place a request). Additionally, people's ride activity in the 
				long term can be tracked. <br/>
				Description: The issue was easy to find: it is the entire 
				purpose of the GET / route. Accessing the route gives a list of 
				all the passengers, including their usernames and locations 
				from which they called a vehicle. See CWE-359 in section VI 
				as well as the image below. <br/>
				Proof of vulnerability: See picture below. <br/>
				<img src="images/get.png" /> <br/>
				Resolution: Do not send this data through the GET / route, 
				and instead use a route similar to GET /vehicle.json that 
				accepts a username through a query string and returns the data 
				associated with it. The queries should be sanitized to remove 
				MongoDB operators. <br/>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h4>V. Conclusion</h4>
	<p>
		In conclusion, the issues found largely dealt with unsanitized input 
		and poor web application design that led to information exposure. The 
		following recommendations are made for future development on the web 
		application:
		<ul>
			<li>
				When accepting inputs from the user, sanitize them as 
				appropriate, either by checking for database operators or by 
				not accepting scripts embedded in inputs. This is a low cost 
				feature to implement and is a few lines of code at most.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not have information about users publicly available. This 
				should only be accessible if proper validation is used. The 
				information of a user should be accessible if and only if 
				the privacy credentials of that user are provided. This 
				requires a partial system redesign. This is a medium cost 
				feature to implement, requiring several hours of time.
			</li>
		</ul>
